# ParticleTechniques
Particle Systems, consisting of instancing &amp; stream-out technique and a benchmarking tool for gathering data.

GPU and CPU computing of particle systems. Computer games have used particle systems for visual effects such as weather, smoke, fog etc and it is relatively low cost to implement. There are a mixture of different techniques used to render particle systems, usually CPU heavy implementations or a pure GPU based one.\\
In this study we will develop two particle system techniques and compare their performance. We will gather- data from the program running each particle system and we will run the experiment in the same environment. We will discuss advantages and disadvantages for both techniques in different scenarios.
